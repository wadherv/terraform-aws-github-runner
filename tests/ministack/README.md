# MiniStack example tests

The MiniStack workflow runs the `base`, `prebuilt`, `default`, `ephemeral`,
`multi-runner`, `multi-runner-v2`, and `termination-watcher` examples directly
with Terraform 1.5.6 and the latest Terraform release, and with OpenTofu 1.11
and the latest OpenTofu release.
The examples with input variables get their inputs from their own tfvars files
in this directory. The `termination-watcher` example has no input variables
and uses the configuration checked into the example itself. No override files,
setup module, or Terraform fixture configuration is checked in. The helper
creates and removes a temporary AMI override for `default` and
`ephemeral`, temporary SSM parameters for `multi-runner`, and temporary AMI
fixtures for `multi-runner-v2`.

Start MiniStack, set the AWS endpoint and test credentials, then run:

```sh
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply base
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply prebuilt
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply default
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply ephemeral
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply multi-runner
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply multi-runner-v2
# or
tests/ministack/run-example.sh apply termination-watcher
```

The script also supports `init`, `plan`, and `destroy`. It creates inert Lambda
ZIP fixtures in the paths expected by the modules when they are absent, and
removes only the files it created. For `prebuilt`, it seeds AMI metadata through
MiniStack's AWS-compatible EC2 API, then removes only the resources it created
during cleanup. MiniStack v1.5.10 provides the EC2 image behavior needed by the
`default`, `ephemeral`, and `multi-runner` examples, so they are included in
the same lifecycle matrix.

## Webhook and runner lifecycle smoke test

The smoke test covers two independent lifecycle chains. The webhook chain
sends signed `workflow_job` webhooks through the API Gateway endpoint and
verifies the asynchronous path through EventBridge, the dispatcher Lambda, SQS,
and the scale-up Lambda. It runs scale-up once without a dynamic label and once
with `ghr-ec2-instance-type:m5.large`, checking that the first launch uses a
configured default instance type and the second launch uses exactly `m5.large`.
The scale-up Lambda calls a pinned `mockserver/mockserver` container initialized
from `github-api-expectations.json`; the test uses MockServer's verification API
to confirm the expected GitHub API calls for both jobs. It also checks the
webhook, dispatcher, and scale-up Lambda log groups for each smoke job ID, then
confirms that both MiniStack EC2 runner instances are removed and terminated.

The second, pool chain then invokes the pool Lambda with a pool size of one and verifies every
expected GitHub API route for pool reconciliation, including the installation,
token, runner-list, and registration-token calls, before confirming that it
creates a second EC2 runner. Installation lookup is mocked for configurations
that do not provide a stored installation ID, but is conditional and is not a
required assertion. The test also verifies the `ghr:Application`,
`ghr:created_by`, `ghr:Type`, and `ghr:Owner` tags used to discover managed
instances. MiniStack v1.5.10 propagates the Terraform launch-template tags to
instances, allowing the scale-down Lambda to discover and remove each runner.
The smoke test invokes scale-down for the webhook and pool-created runners and
verifies the GitHub API calls and EC2 termination.
The pool schedule is configured for a far-future date because the test invokes
the Lambda directly.

Build the two real Lambda distributions, start MiniStack, and run:

```sh
(cd lambdas && yarn install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd lambdas && yarn workspace @aws-github-runner/webhook dist)
(cd lambdas && yarn workspace @aws-github-runner/control-plane dist)
sh tests/ministack/run-smoke.sh
```

The smoke script generates a temporary RSA key and Terraform variables file,
starts the MockServer container on a temporary port, and removes all temporary
state during cleanup. In CI, the pinned MockServer setup action starts the
server and waits for readiness; the expectations are loaded after checkout.
MiniStack must be able to reach
`host.docker.internal`;
override the hostname with `MINISTACK_GITHUB_MOCK_HOST` when using a different
container runtime. When MiniStack is exposed on a non-default local port, use a
host address reachable from its container for `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, for example
`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://<host-ip>:14568`, instead of `127.0.0.1`.
