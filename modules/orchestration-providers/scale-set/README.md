# Scale-set orchestration provider

This internal module deploys long-running GitHub Actions runner scale-set controllers on ECS Fargate. It creates one deployment unit per resolved **controller group**:

```text
1 ECS service
1 task definition
1 running task during normal operation
1 application container
1 ScaleSetController supervising N independent reconcilers
```

Each reconciler still owns exactly one GitHub scale-set identity and one message session. Grouping only packs reconcilers into a shared task; it does not merge scale-set identity, session state, or compute-provider behavior. It does, however, intentionally union task IAM permissions and failure/deployment blast radius across all members of that controller group.

This foundation passes the configured scale-set and runner-group names to the
controller. The controller resolves the GitHub identifiers dynamically,
registers a missing named scale set, and reconciles its system labels at
runtime. The TypeScript controller is the component that calls the GitHub
scale-set API; Terraform never configures those GitHub resources. Terraform
destroy removes the AWS controller and stops reconciliation, but does not issue
a GitHub delete. Deletion and renaming remain explicit operator or
GitHub-administration operations. The complete compute-provider
contract must likewise come from its Terraform adapter; until that adapter and
the public runner-config selection are wired, this internal module is not an
end-to-end deployment interface.

The normalized `(githubConfigUrl, scale_set.name)` ownership tuple must be globally unique across all groups. `runner_registration_level` selects organization or repository scope; `runner_owner` supplies the corresponding path appended to the GitHub server URL. A null enterprise-server URL resolves to GitHub.com. Enterprise-level registration is not supported by this module. Duplicate detection normalizes URL case, one trailing slash, and an explicit default `:443` port, so equivalent spellings cannot accidentally deploy two services against one GitHub message session. Scale-set names may repeat under different GitHub scopes.

## Grouping

`grouping.strategy` selects a plan-known grouping implementation:

- `compute_provider` (default): one group per `compute_provider_contracts[*].type`.
- `runner_config`: one group per runner-config key.
- `custom`: explicit groups whose membership covers every runner config exactly once.

```hcl
grouping = {
  strategy = "custom"
  custom = {
    groups = {
      general = {
        runner_configs = ["linux-small", "linux-large"]
      }
      critical = {
        runner_configs = ["production"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Group names and memberships become Terraform `for_each` identities and must be known during planning. A group may contain at most 1000 runner configs, matching the service loader limit. Additional grouping algorithms can be added later by producing the same internal `map(list(runner_config_name))` shape.

## Compute-provider capability boundary

`compute_provider_contracts` is keyed exactly like `runner_configs`. A compute provider implements the scale-set desired-capacity interface by returning:

```hcl
{
  type = "ec2" # plan-known grouping and runtime registry key
  capabilities = {
    scale_set = {
      configuration_json = local.provider_owned_runtime_configuration
      environment_variables = local.provider_owned_non_secret_environment
      iam_statements     = local.provider_owned_compute_role_statements
    }
  }
}
```

The symbolic locals above represent outputs from the selected compute-provider Terraform adapter; callers should not recreate the provider payload by hand. The provider-specific adapter owns the runtime configuration schema and the complete IAM statement set. This orchestration module treats configuration JSON as an opaque, non-secret object and combines only the selected group's statements into the corresponding compute role. Provider-owned process environment variables are also non-secret: duplicate names within a group must resolve to the same value, and reserved runtime names cannot be overridden. Runner-config-specific values stay in the SSM reconciler document, while credentials stay behind SSM references. Wildcard IAM actions are rejected. The rendered controller and compute-role policies are each checked against AWS's 10,240-byte inline role-policy quota with an explicit split-the-group error; group splitting remains the escape hatch when the union is too large or too broad.

## Configuration delivery

For the current ECS deployment, each task receives one bounded `SCALE_SET_CONTROLLER_MANIFEST` environment variable. Its value is JSON with this shape:

```text
{
  "version": 1,
  "groupName": "ec2",
  "revision": "<sha256>",
  "reconcilers": [
    {
      "schemaVersion": 1,
      "runnerConfigName": "linux-small",
      "runnerGroupName": "Default",
      "scaleSetName": "linux-small",
      "githubConfigUrl": "https://github.com/example",
      "githubApp": {
        "appIdParameterName": "/github/app-id",
        "privateKeyParameterName": "/github/private-key",
        "installationIdParameterName": "/github/installation-id"
      },
      "computeProvider": {
        "type": "ec2",
        "configuration": {}
      },
      "minRunners": 0,
      "maxRunners": 20,
      "bootTimeoutMinutes": 10,
      "sessionOwner": "ec2.linux-small",
      "workFolder": "_work",
      "forceGhes": false,
      "sslVerify": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Each leaf is the flat `ScaleSetReconcilerConfig` consumed by the service. GitHub credential values never enter the manifest; it contains only the exact Parameter Store names used by the runtime. The manifest source is mutually exclusive with the service's SSM group-path source, so the task does not receive `SCALE_SET_CONTROLLER_GROUP_CONFIG_PATH` or `SCALE_SET_CONTROLLER_GROUP_CONFIG_REVISION`.

The controller reads the referenced SSM parameters and optional discovery-cache parameters but does not write discovered IDs back to Parameter Store. This keeps the task role read-only; callers that want cached runner-group IDs must provision them separately.

The module also keeps the per-reconciler SSM parameters available for the grouped configuration path while that delivery mode is being phased in. The task currently uses the manifest environment variable.

Terraform derives `sessionOwner` locally as `<group>.<runner-config>`; if that would exceed the runtime's 256-character limit, the module truncates both readable components and appends a deterministic hash.

The manifest must remain within the ECS task-definition size budget. Use the SSM group-path delivery mode for larger groups once it is enabled by the deployment configuration.

The individual reconciler object has this shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "runnerConfigName": "linux-small",
  "runnerGroupName": "Default",
  "githubConfigUrl": "https://github.com/example",
  "scaleSetName": "linux-small",
  "minRunners": 0,
  "maxRunners": 20,
  "bootTimeoutMinutes": 10,
  "sessionOwner": "ec2.linux-small",
  "workFolder": "_work",
  "forceGhes": false,
  "sslVerify": true,
  "githubApp": {
    "appIdParameterName": "/github/app-id",
    "privateKeyParameterName": "/github/private-key",
    "installationIdParameterName": "/github/installation-id"
  },
  "computeProvider": {
    "type": "ec2",
    "configuration": {}
  }
}
```

GitHub credential **values** never enter Terraform configuration, task definitions, or controller-config parameters. Each leaf carries only three Parameter Store names. The task role can read the exact credential parameter ARNs for its group and decrypt only explicitly declared KMS keys.

## Container image

`container.image` is required. The module intentionally has no mutable default image because the controller image must be published and reviewed independently of the Terraform module. Set it to an immutable release digest:

```hcl
container = {
  image = "ghcr.io/github-aws-runners/terraform-aws-github-runner-scale-set-service@sha256:<release-digest>"
}
```

Public registry images need no ECR pull permission. For a private ECR image, set `container.image` to the ECR image URI. The module grants the ECS task execution role repository-scoped layer-pull permissions plus the unavoidable resource-unscoped `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` action only for that private ECR image. The application task role is not used for image pulls. Repository-side access policy remains owned by the ECR module that owns the repository.

Package visibility may inherit repository or organization settings and must not be inferred only from a successful authenticated workflow push. Verify an anonymous pull before deploying a public-registry image.

## ECS and security behavior

- A managed ECS cluster is created by default. Set `ecs.cluster.mode = "external"` and pass `ecs.cluster.arn` to reuse a cluster. The mode must be known at plan time; the ARN may be computed.
- Every group gets a separate service, task definition, task role, execution role, log group, and security group.
- `desired_count` is fixed at one. Deployment percentages are `minimum = 0` and `maximum = 100`, preventing old and new tasks from overlapping while session leasing is unavailable.
- The ECS deployment circuit breaker and rollback are enabled.
- Tasks run in supplied private subnets with public IP assignment disabled. Managed security groups have no ingress and allow only TCP/443 egress. The default `0.0.0.0/0` is a reachability convenience, not a narrow GitHub allowlist: GitHub publishes outbound ranges at [`https://api.github.com/meta`](https://api.github.com/meta), and adopters should restrict egress to those ranges, a NAT gateway, firewall, or proxy when their security posture requires it.
- The application container runs with a numeric non-root UID/GID, a read-only root filesystem, init enabled, no privilege, and all Linux capabilities dropped.
- ECS probes `/healthz` for liveness, and `container.health_path` accepts only that endpoint. `/readyz` remains an application readiness signal; reconnecting to GitHub should not cause ECS to restart every reconciler in a group.
- CloudWatch encrypts logs at rest with an AWS-owned key by default. Set `logging.kms_key_id` to a customer-managed key ID, alias, or ARN and ensure its key policy allows the regional CloudWatch Logs service.

## Plan-shape requirements

The following values control `for_each`, dynamic IAM statements, or resource ownership and must be known during planning:

- runner-config map keys;
- compute-contract map keys and provider `type`;
- grouping strategy, custom group keys, and membership;
- IAM statement keys and optional KMS/ECR wrapper presence;
- optional ECS ephemeral-storage wrapper presence;
- managed versus external cluster mode.

Inner values such as scale-set names, SSM/KMS ARNs, provider configuration values, IAM actions/resources, and an external cluster ARN may be computed. Nullable computed values should be placed inside a plan-known wrapper rather than used as the wrapper itself.
